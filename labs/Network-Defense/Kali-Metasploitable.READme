Kali Linux ↔ Metasploitable
Network Reconnaissance & Defensive Awareness Lab
Lab Purpose: This lab was conducted to understand how insecure network exposure looks from a defender’s perspective, using Kali Linux and the intentionally vulnerable Metasploitable VM in an isolated VirtualBox environment.
The goal was not exploitation, but to build situational awareness:
1) What traffic is allowed by default?
2) What services are exposed before scanning?
3) What visibility (logs) a real system should provide
4) How defenders reason before an attack ever succeeds

Lab Environment
Attacker / Observer: Kali Linux
Target: Metasploitable2
Virtualization: VirtualBox
Network Mode: Host‑Only Adapter (vboxnet0)
Subnet: 192.168.56.0/24

Host‑only networking was used to:
1) Isolate the lab from the real network
2) Ensure full visibility of traffic
3) Avoid exposing vulnerable services externally
4) Key Defensive Questions (Before Scanning)

Before running any scans, the lab focused on answering three blue‑team questions:
1)What traffic would be allowed by default on a real server?
2)What services might reasonably be exposed?
3)What logs should already exist before exploitation?
This pause is deliberate. Defense begins before the first scan.

>>>>>What Traffic Is Allowed by Default
On a real, well‑managed server, almost nothing is allowed by default.
A sane baseline posture looks like:
1) Inbound traffic: deny all
2) Explicit allows: only required services (e.g. 80/443, limited SSH)
3) Outbound traffic: restricted or closely monitored
4) ICMP: allowed selectively, rate‑limited, and logged

Metasploitable violates this posture intentionally. It allows:
1) Broad inbound connections
2) Legacy and insecure protocols
3) Weakly protected services
4) Minimal or nonexistent firewalling


>>>>>Hardened Server Expectations
A defensive assumption before scanning would be:
1) One primary service (e.g. web)
2) One restricted management plane
3) Everything else disabled or firewalled

>>>>>Metasploitable Reality
Service discovery revealed numerous exposed services, including:
1) FTP, Telnet, SSH
2) SMTP, DNS, HTTP
3) RPC, SMB, NFS
4) Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
5) Remote admin interfaces (VNC, X11)
6) Legacy and intentionally vulnerable daemons

Every running service is a promise you must keep secure.
Attackers don’t care what a service does — only that it answers.

>>>>>Network Reconnaissance Results

1) Host Discovery : nmap -sn 192.168.56.0/24
This confirmed:
  i) Active hosts on the subnet

  ii) ARP and ICMP reachability

  iii) A functioning virtual network

Even this step is reconnaissance and would be logged or alerted on in a real environment.

2) TCP SYN Scan : nmap -sS -T4 192.168.56.4
Key observation: Not shown: 977 closed tcp ports (reset)
This indicates:
  i) The host actively responds to probes
  ii) No meaningful firewalling
  iii) No packet dropping or rate limiting

A hardened system would:
  i) Drop packets silently
  ii) Slow responses
iii) Trigger alerts before enumeration completes
iv) Why Metasploitable Is “Noisy”


>>>>>Logging Expectations on a Real Server

A production system should have memory at multiple layers:
A) Network-Level Logs
  1) Firewall allow/deny events
  2) Connection attempts
  3) ICMP activity
  4) Rate‑limit triggers

B) Host-Level Logs
  1) Authentication attempts
  2) Service start/stop events
  3) Privilege escalation attempts
  4)Crashes and abnormal behavior

C) Application-Level Logs
  1) HTTP access and error logs
  2) Unexpected input patterns
  3) Repeated failures or enumeration attempts

No logs = no memory = no defense

Defense begins before the first packet is sent.

Key Takeaways
1) Most compromises are enabled by exposure, not brilliance
2) Attackers succeed long before exploitation if no one is watching
3) Reducing attack surface matters more than blocking exploits
4) Visibility and prioritization are core blue‑team skills
